# Birdart: The Artful Birdwatching App Built with [Dart](https://www.github.com/dart-lang/sdk)

**Birdart** is an open-source birdwatching application that celebrates the art of observing our feathered friends in their natural habitats. The name **birdart** can be broken down into two parts: "bird art", signifying that birdwatching is a form of art, and "bird dart", highlighting that the app is built using the Dart programming language, Flutter for mobile and web app, DartFrog for back-end.

Birdart aims to provide birders and ornithologists with a comprehensive platform for identifying, tracking, and sharing their sightings of various bird species. With an extensive database of bird species, detailed descriptions, and high-quality images, users can quickly and accurately identify the birds they encounter.

Birdart has its built-in font BirdartGothic, a tree-shaken derivative of Plangothic, therefore, licensed under the same Open Font License as Plangothic. It keeps only the characters used in the Chinese names of birds, including U+2b061 (𫁡), U+2b6da (𫛚), U+2b6ed (𫛭), U+2eb65 (𮭥), U+31250 (𱉐) and U+3127c (𱉼).
